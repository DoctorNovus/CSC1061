# 3.5.1: LAB: What order? (generic methods)

Define a generic method called `checkOrder()` that checks if four items are in ascending, neither, or descending order. The method should return `-1` if the items are in ascending order, `0` if the items are unordered, and `1` if the items are in descending order.

The program reads four items from input and outputs if the items are ordered. The items can be different types, including integers, Strings, characters, or doubles.

**Example Input:**
```
bat hat mat sat
63.2 96.5 100.1 123.5
```

**Example Output:**
```
Order: -1
Order: -1
```
