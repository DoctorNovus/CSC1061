# 1.18.1: LAB: Swap two numbers (EO)

Complete the `swap()` method in `SwapNumbers.java` to exchange the values of the `num` field of two `Number` objects, `num1` and `num2`.

Hint: Refer to the given `Number` class to see the definitions of `num` field and other methods available.

Ex: If `num1` is `19` and `num2` is `178`, calling `swap(num1, num2)` will swap the values so that `num1` becomes `178` and `num2` becomes `19`.
