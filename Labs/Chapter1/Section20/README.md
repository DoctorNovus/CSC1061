# 1.20.1: LAB: Print student roster (EO)

Complete the Course class by implementing the `printRoster()` method, which outputs a list of all students enrolled in a course and also the total number of students in the course.

Given classes:

- Class `Course` represents a course, which contains an `ArrayList` of `Student` objects as a course roster. (Type your code in here)
- Class `Student` represents a classroom student, which has three fields: `first name`, `last name`, and `GPA`. (Hint: `toString()` returns a `String` representation of the `Student` object.)

Ex: If the following students and their GPA values are added to a course:

- Henry Cabot with 3.5 GPA
- Brenda Stern with 2.0 GPA
- Jane Flynn with 3.9 GPA
- Lynda Robison with 3.2 GPA

then the program output is:
```
Henry Cabot (GPA: 3.5)
Brenda Stern (GPA: 2.0)
Jane Flynn (GPA: 3.9)
Lynda Robison (GPA: 3.2)
Students: 4
```
