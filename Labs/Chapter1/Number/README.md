# 1.17.1: LAB: The toString() method (EO)

Write a `toString()` method for the `Number` class, which returns a `String` representation of a `Number` object. The `String` should be in the format `"The value is yourNum"`, where `yourNum` is the value of the integer instance field from the `Number` class

Ex: If the input is:
```
723
```
then the output is:
```
The value is 723
```
