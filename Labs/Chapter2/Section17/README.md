# 2.17.1: LAB: Book information (overriding member methods)

Given `main()` and a base `Book` class, define a derived class called `Encyclopedia` with member methods to `get` and `set` private fields of the following types:

- String to store the edition
- int to store the number of pages

Within the derived Encyclopedia class, define a `printInfo()` method that overrides the `Book` class' `printInfo()` method by printing the `title`, `author`, `publisher`, `publication date`, `edition`, and `number of pages`.

Ex. If the input is:

```
The Hobbit
J. R. R. Tolkien
George Allen & Unwin
21 September 1937
The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Universe
Ian Ridpath
Watson-Guptill
2001
2nd
384
```

the output is:

```
