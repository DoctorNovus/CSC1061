# 2.15.1: LAB: Instrument information (derived classes)

Given `main()` and the `Instrument` class, define a derived class, `StringInstrument`, with methods to `set` and `get` private fields of the following types:

- int to store the number of strings
- int to store the number of frets
- boolean to store whether the instrument is bowed

Ex. If the input is:
```
Drums
Zildjian
2015
2500
Guitar
Gibson
2002
1200
6
19
false
```

the output is:
```
