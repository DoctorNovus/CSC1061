# 2.18.1: LAB: Plant information (ArrayList)

Given a base `Plant` class and a derived `Flower` class, complete `main()` to create an `ArrayList` called `myGarden`. The `ArrayList` should be able to store objects that belong to the `Plant` class or the `Flower` class. Create a method called `printArrayList()`, that uses the `printInfo()` methods defined in the respective classes and prints each element in `myGarden`. The program should read plants or flowers from input (ending with -1), add each `Plant` or `Flower` to the `myGarden` `ArrayList`, and output each element in `myGarden` using the `printInfo()` method.

Ex. If the input is:
```
plant Spirea 10 
flower Hydrangea 30 false lilac 
flower Rose 6 false white
plant Mint 4
-1
```

the output is:

```
Plant 1 Information: 
   Plant name: Spirea
   Cost: 10

Plant 2 Information: 
   Plant name: Hydrangea
   Cost: 30
   Annual: false
   Color of flowers: lilac

Plant 3 Information: 
   Plant name: Rose
   Cost: 6
   Annual: false
   Color of flowers: white

Plant 4 Information: 
   Plant name: Mint
   Cost: 4
```
