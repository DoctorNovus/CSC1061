# 2.14.1: LAB: Pet information (derived classes)

The base class `Pet` has protected fields `petName`, and `petAge`. The derived class `Cat` extends the `Pet` class and includes a `private` field for `catBreed`. Complete `main()` to:

- create a generic pet and print information using `printInfo()`.
- create a `Cat` pet, use `printInfo()` to print information, and add a statement to print the cat's breed using the `getBreed()` method.

Ex. If the input is:
```
Dobby
2
Kreacher
3
Scottish Fold
```

the output is:

```
Pet Information: 
   Name: Dobby
   Age: 2

Pet Information: 
   Name: Kreacher
   Age: 3
   Breed: Scottish Fold
```
