# 2.16.1: LAB: Course information (derived classes)

Given `main()`, define a `Course` base class with methods to `set` and `get` private fields of the following types:

- `String` to store the course number
- `String` to store the course title
- Define Course's `PrintInfo()` method that outputs the course `number` and `title`.

Then, define a derived class `OfferedCourse` with methods to `set` and `get` private fields of the following types:

- String to store the instructor's name
- String to store the location
- String to store the class time

Ex. If the input is:

```
ECE287
Digital Systems Design
ECE387
Embedded Systems Design
Mark Patterson
Wilson Hall 231
WF: 2-3:30 pm
```

the output is:
```
